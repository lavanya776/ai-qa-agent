# QA AI Agent

## Overview

The **QA AI Agent** is an intelligent automation framework designed to enhance quality assurance (QA) processes by leveraging Artificial Intelligence (AI) and Machine Learning (ML) techniques. It automates test case generation, execution, analysis, and reporting, improving test coverage, reducing manual effort, and accelerating software delivery without compromising on quality.

## Key Features

- **Automated Test Case Generation:**  
  Utilizes AI to generate meaningful and diverse test cases based on application specifications, user behavior data, or historical testing patterns.

- **Intelligent Test Execution:**  
  Automatically selects and prioritizes test cases to optimize test runs and reduce time while maintaining risk coverage.

- **Self-Healing Tests:**  
  Detects UI changes or failures and adapts test scripts accordingly, reducing maintenance overhead.

- **Natural Language Processing (NLP):**  
  Supports test creation or querying via natural language inputs, easing collaboration between technical and non-technical stakeholders.

- **Advanced Analytics and Reporting:**  
  Provides actionable insights from test runs, failure diagnostics, and trend analysis through dashboards and detailed reports.

- **Integration Ready:**  
  Seamlessly integrates with popular CI/CD pipelines, test management tools, issue trackers, and version control systems.

## Why Build QA AI Agent?

Quality assurance remains a critical bottleneck in fast-paced software development. Traditional testing approaches often struggle with:

- Increasing complexity of applications,
- Manual test design and maintenance costs,

This contains everything you need to run your app locally.

## Run Locally

**Prerequisites:**  Node.js


1. Install dependencies:
   `npm install`
2. Set the "API_KEY" in [.env.local](.env.local) to your LLM API key
3. Run the app:
   `npm run dev`
